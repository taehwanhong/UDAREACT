1. Composition
* composition is just combining simple functions together to create complex functions.

2. imperative code vs Declarative Code

 선언과 명렁어.
 react is Declarative

3. Data binding in other Frameworks
 - 

4. React is just a JS

 - a couple of important JS func that are vital to func programming that we should look at. 
 - those are...
 1. .map()
 2. .filter()

4.1 .map() method
```  
   const names = ['michael', 'Ryan', 'Tyler'];
   const nameLengths = names.map( name => name.length);
```

the .map() method returns a new array. it does not modify the original array
